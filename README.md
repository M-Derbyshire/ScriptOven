# ScriptOven
## A browser-based application for data manipulation, not matter who's machine you're using.

ScriptOven was designed for people who would like to manipulate data with their own scripts, but who don't have the access permissions to use a command shell, or to install a scripting language (such as Perl or Python).

Users can instead write their script in Javascript, and then upload them onto ScriptOven, to be ran on their data. There are also helper functions within ScriptOven that make it easier to work with CSV data (see the “testMainScript.js” file, in the project's root directory, for an example of this).

Go to /documentation to find both the user guide, and the developer guide.
